# CHAD

For the computer architecture course that I'm taking, we were tasked to build an assembler & a simulator for an ISA called CHAD (lol).

This is my progress so far, this repository contains both the simulator and the assembler.

## make cheatsheet

`make sim`

`make asm`

`make sim_test`

`make asm_test`

`NAME=fib make test`
